# The-Learning-Agency-Lab---PII-Data-Detection
Kaggle Competition

## Description
Students' Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is crucial, especially considering the potential risks posed by releasing this data publicly. Educational databases containing sensitive information like names, addresses, etc. pose a real threat to student privacy if not adequately protected. Acknowledging this challenge, this project aims to create effective methods for detecting and removing Personally Identifiable Information from educational data, while still preserving the usability and reliability of the data.

This project utilizes modern Natural Language Processing model DistilBERT to improve the effectiveness and precision of PII detection. By harnessing this state-of-the-art technology, goal is to pave the way for generating high-quality public education datasets while preserving privacy.
